## Creative Coding

In the "Creative Coding" module, we further developed our skills in p5.js, building on the foundational knowledge that we have gained in "Bits and Atoms". 
To deepen our understanding, we were given two assignments that challenged us to apply the things we learned in a project.

## Assignment 1

The first assignment involved creating an interactive typography. My goal was to create a typography where the points move away from the mouse cursor. The sample factor and color of the expanding points can be controlled by using sliders. Users can input their own text through a text bar or toggle between the words "IAD" and "ZHDK" by pressing the keys "1" and "2". The font can be changed by clicking on the canvas and the size of the typography can be adjusted by pressing the spacebar.

## Assignment 2

For the second assignment, the task was to create an annoying microinteraction. I decided to focus on buttons. 
I created a button that moves away from the cursor five times before it finally stays in the center and becomes pressable. Once clicked, it spawns multiple fake buttons, and the real “Click Me” button has to be found. The real button stands out by being in all caps and colored in pink. Pressing the wrong button causes all buttons to multiply, making it even harder to find the true “Click Me” button. If the actual "Click Me" button is pressed in time, a character walks in and a congrats sign appears. If the button isn’t clicked in time, the character walks in and an error message appears.
